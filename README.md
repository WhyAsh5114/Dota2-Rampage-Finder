# Dota2-Rampage-Finder
Simply run the code in an IDE and enter:
1. Steam Account ID (aka Friend ID)
2. Steam Web API Key (https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
3. Number of matches to look for rampages


Requirements:
1. dota2api
2. kivy
3. requests


Limitations:
1. Can only look for 100 matches per hero
2. Too old unparsed matches won't be able to be parsed as their replays are no longer available


(Kivy might be needed to be installed using anaconda with python3.7)
